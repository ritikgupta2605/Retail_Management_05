TruEstate – SDE Intern Assignment
Role: Software Development Engineer Intern (6 Months + Performance-Based PPO)
Submission Deadline: 08 December 2025, 11:59 PM (IST)

Assignment Overview
Your task is to develop a Retail Sales Management System that demonstrates essential software
engineering capabilities across both frontend and backend components.
The system must support advanced Search, Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination functionalities
based on the dataset specifications provided.
Your implementation should reflect:
 Strong foundational problem-solving and engineering approach
 Clean, maintainable, and modular architecture
 UI built according to provided structural guidelines
 Accurate and efficient handling of structured sales data
 Professional execution aligned with real-world SDE responsibilities
This assignment represents challenges similar to those faced in production-grade systems at
TruEstate.

Sales Data Requirements
Use the provided dataset, which includes the following attributes:
Customer Fields:
 Customer ID
 Customer Name
 Phone Number
 Gender
 Age
 Customer Region
 Customer Type
Product Fields:

 Product ID
 Product Name
 Brand
 Product Category
 Tags
Sales Fields:
 Quantity
 Price per Unit
 Discount Percentage
 Total Amount
 Final Amount
Operational Fields:
 Date
 Payment Method
 Order Status
 Delivery Type
 Store ID
 Store Location
 Salesperson ID
 Employee Name
Your system must correctly interpret and process all these attributes.

Functional Requirements
1. Search
Implement full-text search across the following fields:
 Customer Name
 Phone Number
Search must be:
 Case-insensitive
 Accurate
 Performant

 Able to work alongside filters and sorting

2. Filters (Multi-Select)
Implement multi-select or range-based filtering for:
 Customer Region
 Gender
 Age Range
 Product Category
 Tags
 Payment Method
 Date Range
Filters must:
 Work independently
 Work in combination
 Maintain state alongside sorting and search

3. Sorting
Implement sorting for:
 Date (Newest First)
 Quantity
 Customer Name (A–Z)
Sorting must preserve active search and filters.

4. Pagination
 Page size: 10 items per page
 Must support Next / Previous navigation
 Must retain active search, filter, and sort states

UI Requirements

Follow a clear, minimal, and structured layout:
 Search Bar

 Filter Panel
 Transaction Table (List/Grid)
 Sorting Dropdown
 Pagination Controls
The UI may be styled creatively, but must align with the provided structure.

Engineering Requirements
Your solution must demonstrate professional coding standards:

General
 Clear separation of frontend and backend responsibilities
 Clean, readable, maintainable code
 Predictable state management
 No duplicate logic for filtering or sorting
 Avoid unnecessary nesting or complexity
 Use best coding practices
